# Dementia Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms
The purpose of the project; Diagnosing the disease by creating a machine learning model on a data set consisting the data of adults and elderly individuals with or without dementia that includes factors such as data obtained from MR images , scores from memory tests, educational and socioeconomic status, age and gender.

This study is based on the comparison and evaluation of different machine learning algorithms. 
From  the classification algorithms; K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree were used. Hyperparameters were determined by applying GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross validation for each model. It was determined that the best model is the decision tree model.
